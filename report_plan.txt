long term trend (LTT) - linear regression

Change to dual linear regression?

current equilibrium
    if above LTT sell order
    if below LTT buy order

1. linear regression to change trader type to buy or sell

2. estimated mean average to find limit order price

3. ZIP fulfil LO

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Zip
Analysis of effectiveness of Zip as a market maker
Planned improvements based on analysis

Analysis of new MM:
    Homogeneous market
    Heterogeous market
    Speed of convergence on price equilibrium
    Changes to market condition

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

1. add spread to long term trend (dual linear regression)
2. restrict regression to recent transactions
3. refuse orders that happen before building up a history / give very favourable intial orders
4. crossover
5. predict price use future time
6. delete orders on a basis of if a new order is better rather than staleness

---------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

1. rewrite Adam's plotting functions

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

1. thinking behind the algorithm
2. difference between mm and sales traders
3. buckle in buckeroo

ANALYSIS:

1. why the algi works
    a. linear regression for long term 
2. why it doesnt work so well
3. effects of differnt market conditions
4. effects of differrent starting price 
5. effects of different trader distributions

Improvements:
                \
1. O8=> ~~~  >^-8{(|\) : )\ 
                /

2. account for outliers in regression
