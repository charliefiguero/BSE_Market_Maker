long term trend (LTT) - linear regression

Change to dual linear regression?

current equilibrium
    if above LTT sell order
    if below LTT buy order

1. linear regression to change trader type to buy or sell

2. estimated mean average to find limit order price

3. ZIP fulfil LO

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Zip
Analysis of effectiveness of Zip as a market maker
Planned improvements based on analysis

Analysis of new MM:
    Homogeneous market
    Heterogeous market
    Speed of convergence on price equilibrium
    Changes to market condition

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

1. add spread to long term trend (dual linear regression)
2. restrict regression to recent transactions
3. refuse orders that happen before building up a history / give very favourable intial orders
4. crossover
5. predict price use future time
6. delete orders on a basis of if a new order is better rather than staleness

Introduction:

1. thinking behind the algorithm
2. difference between mm and sales traders
3. buckle in buckeroo

ANALYSIS:

1. why the algi works
    a. linear regression for long term 
2. why it doesnt work so well
3. effects of differnt market conditions
4. effects of differrent starting price 
5. effects of different trader distributions

Improvements:
                \
1. O8=> ~~~  >^-8{(|\) : )\ 
                /

2. account for outliers in regression
3. Dual Linear Regression - factor in distance from LTT when deciding to buy/sell

FIND 1 NOVEL EVALUATION TECHNIQUE

PLOT DIMM

statistically significant - repeat experiments

repetition is important due to the stocastic nature of the market

REPORT PLAN:

Introduction
- What is a Market Maker
- What are its goals

BSE
- Assumptions it makes
- Limitations (only change buy sell in bookkeep)
- Capabilites

Design of My MM
- Linear Regression
- EMA
- ZIP to refine buy/sell orders
- No trades before sufficient inventory

Experiment Goals
- BSE is stocastic so want to take multiple runs
- Explore how the algorithm holds up in different market situations
- Comparison against DIMM as a baseline

How do the differnt parts of the algorithm work together
- ZIP on its own
- EMA on its own
- Linear Regression on its own
- What happens when trades happen at the start
- Inventory represents exposure to the market 
- effects of history on linear regression

How does it handle different market situations
- static
- oscillating
- bear/bull
- wider/narrower range

How does it handle different market populations
- No GVWY
- Competetive markets
- Shavers
- exhaustive trials?

Improvements
- change exposure depending of volatility of markets
- shorter history
- ignore outliers
